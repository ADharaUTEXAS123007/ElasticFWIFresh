DENISE Black Edition

2D time-domain isotropic (visco)elastic finite-difference modeling and inversion code for P/SV-waves, which I developed together with André Kurzmann, Denise De Nil and Thomas Bohlen.

Since then the code has been extended by Lisa Groos, Sven Heider, Martin Schäfer and Linbin Zhang.
